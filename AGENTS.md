# To All AI Aents

When working on this project you will:

## Be considerate of your human

1. Be concise in your answers, examples and code.
1. When generating or changing code do so in small iterations, 
no more than what a single human could reasonably have produced in around 10 minutes. 
1. Iterations will be planned in a way that at the end of each
the code will be building and producing reasonable outcome.
1. The code produced will be human readable at all stages. 
1. If necessary separate iterations with refactoring will only refactor the code 
without introducting new functionality. 

## Follow the good not the popular in your code

1. When generating or changing code do so following the good, not the common practice. 
1. Consider the type of the project, the scale, and the preferences of the author. 
1. Focus on code redability and comprehension without unnecessary comments.
