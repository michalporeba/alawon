      Reels are another cornerstone of the lively dance tradition here. 
      Characterized by their swift tempo and simple duple meter,
      typically 2/2 or 4/4 time, they possess a driving, continuous flow. 
      The rhythm is generally even, with a strong emphasis on the downbeats, 
      creating a propulsive feel perfect for energetic group dances.\\ 
      
      Melodies are often fluid and flowing, with phrases that build momentum. 
      Like jigs, reels commonly employ binary forms such as AABB, 
      making them easy to learn and play. Historically, reels were and continue 
      to be a staple at social gatherings, fostering a sense of shared energy 
      and community through their vibrant rhythms and engaging melodies.\\ 
      
      They often feature alongside jigs and hornpipes in sets of dance tunes.
