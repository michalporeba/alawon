      energetic forms, retaining a sense of grace and elegance derived from 
      their courtly origins.\\
      
      While typically in 3/4 time with a gentle swaying rhythm emphasizing the first beat, 
      some traditional settings also appear in 6/4 time. This less common time signature 
      can emphasize the longer, more flowing melodic phrases often found in these tunes, 
      creating a broader and more expansive feel to the dance. Regardless of the time 
      signature, the tempo is generally moderate, allowing for measured movements.\\ 
      
      Though perhaps less common for lively communal dances than jigs or reels, 
      minuets would have been enjoyed for more formal or processional occasions, 
      showcasing a different facet of social interaction and musical expression.\\ 
      
      Their form often includes repeated sections, maintaining a balanced and graceful structure.
