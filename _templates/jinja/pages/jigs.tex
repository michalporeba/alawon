      Jigs in the traditional music here are lively and often playful dances. 
      Historically popular at social gatherings and celebrations, 
      they are characterized by their quick tempo and distinctive compound meter, 
      most commonly 6/8 time. This creates a characteristic "skipping" feel 
      with two groups of three quavers per beat. Melodies are typically fast-moving 
      and intricate, often featuring a single eight-bar strain repeated (AABB) 
      or two contrasting strains (AB).\\

      Jigs embody a spirit of merriment and social interaction, providing energetic 
      accompaniment to communal dances and contributing to the vibrant 
      atmosphere of local festivities. They are a cornerstone of the dance music 
      tradition, often played alongside reels and hornpipes.
