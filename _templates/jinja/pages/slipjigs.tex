      Slip jigs are elegant and flowing dance tunes, also known for their 9/8 time 
      signature. This compound triple meter gives them a characteristic "tripping" 
      or "skipping" feel, with three groups of three quavers per bar.\\
      
      While sharing the "jig" family name, the 9/8 time creates a smoother, 
      more lilting rhythm than the more common 6/8 jig. Slip jig melodies are often 
      graceful and lyrical, with a slightly faster tempo than some other jig types, 
      contributing to their airy quality.\\
      
      Historically, they were enjoyed at social gatherings and dances, offering a 
      different rhythmic flavour within the jig repertoire. Their form typically 
      involves repeated eight-bar sections (AABB), providing a clear structure for both 
      musicians and dancers.\\
      
      They showcase a refined and lighter side of the traditional dance music.
